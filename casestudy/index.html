                <p>
                    When taking a look at <a href="https://www.szactrl.com/" target="_blank">szactrl.com</a>, a highlight that catches everyone's eye is the is lively and unique animated menu.
                    However its lack of navigational functionality leaves more to be desired.
                    As Steve Jobs famously said, “Design is not just what it looks like & feels like. Design is how it works.”
                    Leading with that mindset, I set out to make a new animated menu microinteraction for <a href="https://www.szactrl.com/" target="_blank">szactrl.com</a> that reduced complexity, streamlined navigation, all while focusing on details that spark joy.

                    Microinteractions are series/sequences of linked triggers and feedback that are used to connect with the user.
                    They are made up of triggers, rules, feedback, and loops/modes.
                    Microinteractions can be used to enhance digital experiences, express brand identity, present information, prevent errors, and just about anything that involves communicating with users.
                    <br><br>
                    With this project, first I was tasked with identifying and detailing the elements necessary to create a new memorable digital experience.
                    Then, with holistic consideration of UX and proper usage of front-end scripting, code those designs to be interactive and functioning.
                    This holistic consideration includes the brand identity, content strategy, information architecture, and usability.

                    <h3> the problem! </h3>
                </div>
            
                    <p>
                        One of my all-time favorite artists, SZA, has a very deliberate, creative approach to her persona, image, and online presence.
                        Everything she does is well thought out with intention, and her artistry connects with millions. Her website is no different.
                        <a href="https://www.szactrl.com/" target="_blank">Szactrl.com</a> is definitely a non-traditional digital space where she takes an unique approach from the very start, namely with her animated menu.
                        However, while the animation of this menu is entertaining and creative, users may feel it is not as engaging as SZA and her digital team may have intended.
                    <br><br>
                        After the almost 7-second long loading animation for the wheel plays, there is no menu made visible from the wheel icon.
                        Users are left confused when the wheel takes them to an entirely different page where the menu items ("music", "merch", "video", "photo diary") are simply just displayed in 4 separate corners of the screen.
                    <br><br>
                        What was the point of a lengthy loading sequence if there is no menu that appears either concurrent or after the wheel’s animation?
                        Why is the wheel labeled "menu", when no menu is accessible directly from it?
                    <br><br>
                        While I didn't have the answers to those questions for SZA's site, what I did have is solutions and ideas for a new animated menu microinteraction that would not raise those same questions.
                    </p>

                    <img class="original_gif" src="images/gifs/original.gif" alt="gif of original animated menu">
                    


            </div>


            <div class="section">
    
                <div class="section__header">
                    <h3> my goals & objectives </h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The wheel is a symbol for the common motif of nostalgia that SZA is always connected with.
                    The lively nature of the wheel creates an emotional impact on the user, which is both a characteristic of both SZA’s identity and microinteractions.
                    I wanted to keep that playful aspect of the wheel’s movement, but create a new microinteraction that is actually functional and isn’t excessive in its duration. 
                    <br><br>
                    Getting specific, I wanted to create a microinteraction that was first and foremost, freestanding. I wanted the four menu items ("music", "merch", "video", "photo diary") to be accessible from this microinteraction, and not direct the user to a new page.
                    Next, I wanted the microinteraction to still be playful and lively, to reflect SZA and her current website. 
                    The details should still delight the user, just not in an obstructive manner.
                    Lastly, I wanted the microinteraction to run efficiently and to increase my knowledge with Javascript and CSS animations/transitions. 
                    
                </p>

            <div class="section">
    
                <div class="section__header">
                    <h3> the plan & process </h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Over the course of the term, I would tackle this project and achieve my goals by breaking down the process into three different phases: the alpha, the beta, and the final.
                    Additionally, each of those phases had two steps within: a description and a build.
                    <br><br>
                    Each phase started with the description, where the triggers, rules, feedback, and modes/loops were listed out as explicitly and precisely as possible.
                    The description served as a guide for the next step, the build.
                    In the build, I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to code what actions I detailed in the description.
                    <br><br>
                    Breaking up the planning and construction of the microinteraction into three distinct parts helped me focus on the details, troubleshoot along the way, and receive feedback from my professor and peers.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
    
                <div class="section__header">
                    <h3> starting with the alpha... </h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    To start, I wanted to just establish the primary motion of the wheel, as it rolled horizontally, but spanned the entire microinteraction.
                    This movement was the foundation for the rest of the animation.
                    I made this simple animation purely with CSS.
                    During this phase, I explored how much visual space I wanted my microinteraction to take up, and the overall duration as well.
                </p>

            <div class="section">
    
                <div class="section__header">
                    <h3> onto the beta... </h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Next, it was time to get a little more complex.
                    Using the style.transform property in Javascript, I coded out each animation that was to take place, triggered by eventListeners.
                    <br><br>
                    In terms of appearance, I coded exactly what I had visualized!
                    Unfortunately, due to my lack of experience in Javascript at this phase, there were also bugs that were affecting the functionality of the wheel.
                    The most notable one was the wheel would rotate on its own when the page loaded, even with no interaction.
                    <br><br>
                    This was the turning point (literally) that made me reevaluate the structure of my microinteraction, and brainstorm a better sequence for movement and animations that could be done primarily in CSS instead of Javascript.
                </p>

                    <h3> and finalizing solutions!</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    After my struggles experienced in the beta phase, I went back to the drawing board to find a more efficient, straightforward, and robust method to animate my wheel and menu items.
                    I moved a bulk of my code from Javascript into CSS.
                    I used the transition property to create very simple changes in different styles.
                    As well as a toggle function in my Javascript, for the back and forth movement of the wheel. 
                    <br><br>
                    This is where another major problem arose.
                    When the wheel was “toggled on” with the first click, I wanted the menu items to fade in one by one from left to right.
                    Then, when the wheel was “toggled off”, I wanted the menu items to fade out in the reverse order, from right to left.
                    However, with the limitations of the Javascript toggle, it would not automatically reverse the direction, and the menu items would animate out the same direction they animated in, not taking account for the delay I had set.
                    Visually, this was unappealing and confusing for the user.
                    I had to create separate classes for the fade in and fade out of the menu items to resolve this.
                    <br><br>
                    
                    If this microinteraction was implemented into <a href="https://www.szactrl.com/" target="_blank">szactrl.com</a>, then clicking each menu item would directly take the user to either “music”, “merch”, “video”, or “photo diary”.

                    Although there were undeniably many unexpected changes and moments of frustration, I consider this project a success and also a personal achievement.
                    Reflecting on the goals and objectives I had set, I was able to make an independent microinteraction from scratch, increase my knowledge of HTML/CSS/JS, and find opportunities to delight users as well.
                    <br><br>
                    On a more personal level, I had always been wary and avoidant of using Javascript in my projects, but I wanted that to change with this project.
                    During the beta phase, I jumped head first into Javascript, seemingly abandoning my already established knowledge of CSS.
                    My mentality revolved around the notion that in order to develop an understanding of Javascript, I had to exclusively use it to create the entire project and figure it out on my own.
                    This proved to be detrimental to my progress, and spurred a rather overwhelming sense of frustration every week.
                    When I started feeling my passion for this project shrinking, I knew I had to make a change to my approach.
                    I started using Javascript as a tool alongside my CSS to get more out of the code I was already familiar with.
                    This helped me work more efficiently and simultaneously learn more.
                    <br><br>
                    While I am nowhere near as proficient as I would like to be in Javascript, I am definitely ready to tackle another project using a combination of front-end scripting languages to bring my ideas to life!
